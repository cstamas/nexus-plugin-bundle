      <description>
        Abstract lifecycle mapping for an application plugin build. These plugins all build in basically
        the same way, are assembled the same way for installation in the applicatin, and share a
        common plugin descriptor format. Therefore, the only thing we need to do for new applications
        supporting this sort of plugin system is alias this abstract mapping using 
        org.sonatype.maven.plugin.app.DelegatingLifecyleMapping.

              <!-- NEXUS-4254: due to Maven core incapabilities to interfere with pre-defined packaging lifecycle,
              we moved the bundle creation to "pre-integration-test" phase to make this plugin play nice with nexus-test-environment-maven-plugin.
              Since Maven guarantees that lifecycle defined plugins will execute before POM defined ones, we are guaranteed that bundle
              will be created before the nexus-test-environment-maven-plugin plugin checks for deps and the bundle of currently built plugin.
              
              Note: we moved this step out of "package" phase, since donation of Nexus Indexer to ASF, as it was moved out of Nexus codebase
              and shading become a necessity for nexus-indexer-lucene-plugin. The guarantee mentioned above also _prevented_ us to modify
              the JAR (with shading for example) that got into the bundle, and this was the initial reason why we moved bundle create to a latter
              phase. -->
